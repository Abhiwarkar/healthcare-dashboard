## üß∞ Development Notes

### Component Design Philosophy

Components are structured following these principles:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a specific purpose
- **Composability**: Components can be combined to create more complex UIs
- **Reusability**: Common elements are abstracted into reusable components
- **Prop-Based Configuration**: Components are configured via props

### Styling Approach

- **Utility-First**: Tailwind CSS classes for most styling needs
- **Global Styles**: Limited global styles for consistent defaults
- **Responsive Utilities**: Custom responsive classes for specific use cases
- **CSS Variables**: Used for theming and consistent values
